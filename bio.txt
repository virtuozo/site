Hi there! Welcome aboard. I am a Software Engineer and I work day by day with Java applications more than a decade and I love it. The common questions I have got is why I have created Virtuozo? The short answer is that I am learning with Huskies how to do a very strong software design for web applications. The long one is that I am tired to build on every project the same structures and filling the same gaps. I did not reinvent the wheel. I just filled out some gaps that is commom in terms of web application development and you can find all of them here.
